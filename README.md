## An idealized 1.5-layer isentropic model with convection and precipitation for satellite data assimilation research

This repository contains the relevant source code and documentation for the research papers: 

```Cantarello et al (2022): An idealised 1.5-layer model with convection and precipitation for satellite data assimilation research. Part I: model dynamics;```
```Bokhove et al (2022): An idealised 1.5-layer model with convection and precipitation for satellite data assimilation research. Part II: model derivation;```

both accepted for publication on the Journal of the Atmosheric Sciences (Early Online Release: <a href='https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-21-0022.1/JAS-D-21-0022.1.xml'>Part I</a>; <a href='https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-21-0023.1/JAS-D-21-0023.1.xml'>Part II</a>). It also includes the code used in Luca Cantarello's PhD (Cantarello 2021, available <a href='https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/29672/'>here</a>) which uses a revised version of the idealised fluid model developed by Tom Kent (modRSW; Kent et al. 2017) and a Deterministic Ensemble Kalman Filter (DEnKF) to run satellite data assimilation experiments. This README contains sufficient instruction for users to download, implement and adapt the source code, which briefly comprises Python3 scripts for the numerical solver for the discretised model, data assimilation algorithms, plotting and data analysis.

## Getting started
### Versions -- Check!!
All of the source code is written in Python and relies heavily on the numpy module, amongst others. The plotting routines require matplotlib. The versions used in this development are tabled below. Other versions may work of course, but have not been tested by the authors.

Software      | Version
------------- | -------------
Python  | 3.8.3
Matplotlib  | 3.2.2
Numpy  | 1.18.5

To check python version, from the terminal:
```
python --version
```

To check numpy version, open python in the terminal, import it and use the version attribute:
```
>>> import numpy
>>> numpy.__version__
```
Same for all other modules. 

### Download and install

Clone from terminal (recommended):
* Go to the directory where you want to save the repository and use the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/modRSW-convective-scale-DA/ismodRSW_satDA.git
```
* Once downloaded, to get any updates/upgrades to the original clone, use the command:
```
git pull https://github.com/modRSW-convective-scale-DA/ismodRSW_satDA.git
```

Direct download: 
* click on the download link on the repository url [https://github.com/modRSW-convective-scale-DA/ismodRSW_satDA](https://github.com/modRSW-convective-scale-DA/ismodRSW_satDA) and save to desired directory.

### Running the code: basics

All python scripts of the repository can be executed from terminal, from inside the ismodRSW_sat repository:
```
python name_of_script.py config/config_file.py [additional arguments]
```
To kill at any point, press ```Ctrl+c```, or kill the active processes using ```top``` from the terminal.

## Brief overview of files
Here is an overview of the files contained in this repository and what they do. They are listed in the order they need to be modified or run.

### Configuration file and look-up table
* *configs/config_example.py*: this file contains all the parameters, file paths and values used for running the ismodRSW model, creating the observing system and  setting up the data assimilation algorithm.
* *inversion_tables/generate_sig_eta.py*: this script should be run as soon as the configuration file has been set up. It takes the configuration file as only argument:
``` 
python3 inversion_tables/generate_sig_eta.py configs/config_example.py ```
```

### Model only
* *run_ismodRSW.py*: this script is used to run the ismodRSW model without any data assimilation. It takes the configuration file as only argument:
```
python3 run_ismodRSW.py configs/config_example.py
```
* *hovmoller.py*: this script can be used to plot a Hovm√∂ller plot of the output of run_ismodRSW.py, which needs to be run first. It takes the configuration file as only argument:
```
python3 hovmoller.py configs/config_example.py
```

### Assimilation framework
* *create_truth+obs.py*: this script generates the nature run trajectory of the ismodRSW model and generate the observations. It takes the configuration file as only argument:
```
python3 create_truth+obs.py configs/config_example.py
```
* *offlineQ.py*: this script calculates the model error covariance matrix Q as specified in the configuration file. It needs the script *create_truth+obs.py* to be run first. It takes the configuration file as only argument:
```
python3 offlineQ.py configs/config_example.py
```
* *main_p.py*: this script launches the main data assimilation routine. It needs both the scripts *create_truth+obs.py* and *offlineQ.py* to be run first. It takes the configuration file as only argument:
```
python3 main_p.py configs/config_example.py
```

### Plotting and data analysis
* *plot_func_t.py*: this script generates time series of various domain-average statistics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and Obsevation Influence Diagnostics (OID). It takes the configuration file as first argument and an integer indicating the experiment as second argument.
```
python3 plot_func_t.py configs/config_example.py exp_index lead_time1 lead_time2
```
* *plot_func_x.py*: this script generates snapshots of
